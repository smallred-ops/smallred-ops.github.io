## Overview

<!-- Abstract -->
We are currently living in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, where noise and scalability are well-known and crucial issues. We have been witnessing the rapid development of superconducting quantum computers, which gradually alleviates scalability issues where we have quantum computer with 433 qubits from IBM. However, the high noise in quantum computing is still a barrier to the use of quantum computing in real-world applications. For ibm_belem processor, the qubits error is at the level of 10^-4 to 10^-2.
Although they have great potential to work well on a fixed noise level, the change of noise will make the pre-designed noise-aware solution useless and incur high overhead for solution adaptation. Unfortunately, the noises on quantum devices are unstable.
This workshop is proposed to develop an open platform to present the unstable issue to the quantum computing research community, report the state-of-the-art development efforts, exchange ideas and practices, and foster research collaboration to develop novel techniques to address the unstable noise issue and provide a reproducible quantum computing system.

<!-- objective -->
The objective of the proposed workshop on the unstable noise of quantum computing is to address one of the most significant challenges in the development of quantum computing, which is the issue of unstable noise. The workshop aims to bring together experts and researchers from different backgrounds to explore and share their insights on this critical problem. The objective is to provide a platform to discuss different approaches to mitigating noise, including error-correction techniques, noise-reducing algorithms, and hardware improvements.

The detailed objectives are listed as follows:
* Develop a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research on unstable noise in quantum computing.
* Provide a platform for researchers and industry experts to present and discuss their latest findings and insights on mitigating unstable noise in quantum computing.
* Foster collaboration among researchers and industry experts to develop novel techniques and strategies for addressing unstable noise in quantum computing.
* Facilitate discussions on the limitations of current techniques and identify areas where further research is needed.
* Encourage the development of reproducible quantum computing systems that can effectively mitigate unstable noise.
* Provide an opportunity for attendees to network and build new collaborations in the field of quantum computing.

## Abstract

As we enter the Quantum Utility era, high performance, stability, and reliability are key requirements for unleashing the power of quantum computing for varied applications, from chemistry, economy, and materials to healthcare. StableQ focuses on stability issues caused by the unstable hardware noise in quantum computing, which has been recently observed by [1, 2] and approached by initial efforts like [3, 4]. This workshop is proposed to develop an open platform to present the unstable issue to the quantum computing and computing architecture research community, report the state-of-the-art development efforts, exchange ideas and practices, and foster research collaboration to develop novel techniques to address the unstable noise issue and provide a reproducible quantum computing architecture. We aim to bring together experts and researchers from different backgrounds to explore and share their insights on this critical problem. We expect to discuss different approaches to mitigating noise, including error correction techniques, noise-reducing algorithms, and hardware improvements.

## Venue

This workshop is part of the 57th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO 2024) scheduled on November 2–6, 2024 in Austin, Texas, USA.

## Workshop History

The first "StableQ: Quantum System Stability and Reproducibility Workshop" was hosted at IEEE Quantum Week (https://stableq.github.io/) in Bellevue, Washington on Sep 17–22, 2023. In the 1st  StableQ workshop, we accepted 7 published papers and invited 1 keynote talk as well as 4 contribution talks. The presentations were given by people from federal agencies (e.g., NSF, ORNL, PNNL), industry (e.g., IBM, IonQ, Zapata Computing), and academia (e.g., MIT, Imperial College London, Johns Hopkins University). The event had over 80-person times in attendance.  

Quantum computing architectures and systems have rapidly developed in recent years. In the past year, after the StableQ workshop, we have witnessed the scale-up of quantum processors, new quantum devices, and a lot of new potential applications. Stability and reproducibility issues still exist, and finding solutions becomes more challenging due to the growing complexity of hardware (e.g., large scale, heterogeneity). In the StableQ workshop this year, we expect to solicit new solutions to address the stability and reproducibility issues, and we believe this topic will resonate with the MICRO community and its interest in novel architecture approaches to solving challenging problems.

## Call for Papers

We invite submissions to the StableQ workshop, which is jointly held at the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture. The workshop will provide a platform for researchers and industry experts to present and discuss the latest advances in mitigating unstable noise in quantum computing.  

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Different approaches to mitigating noise across the quantum computing stack, including hardware improvements, architecture designs, noise-reducing algorithms, and error-correction techniques.
* Novel quantum architectures and coupled optimization techniques to mitigate the effects of unstable noise.
* Quantum error correction codes and fault-tolerant quantum computing.
* Machine learning for quantum noise mitigation.
* Benchmarking and characterization of noise in quantum computing systems.
* Applications of quantum computing in noisy environments.
* Quantum error suppression and noise-tolerant quantum algorithms.
* Hybrid classical-quantum algorithms for noise mitigation.
* Quantum error models and noise simulations.

We welcome submissions of original research papers, as well as papers that present novel ideas and perspectives on the topic of unstable noise in quantum computing from the architecture and system perspectives. Submissions should follow the MICRO 2024 conference format and must not exceed 4 pages, including references. All submissions will undergo a peer-review process by the workshop’s program committee. Accepted papers will be presented in the workshop as oral presentations or posters.  


## Important Dates 
* Submission Deadline: Aug. 30, 2024
* Notification of Acceptance: Sep. 15, 2024
* Camera-Ready Deadline: Sep. 30, 2024
* Registration Deadline: Oct. 15, 2024
